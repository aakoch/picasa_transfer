# Picasa Transfer

I'm not really transferring anything except maybe information from a .picasa.ini file to my brain.  I would like a way to pull out the information saved in my old Picasa ini files. I'm not sure what I'm going to do once I get this information out. I guess ideally would be to add the info as IPTC data.

I'm just using this as a way to practice my Kotlin.
